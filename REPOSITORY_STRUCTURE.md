# Repository structure

`REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md` is the canonical repository map for Poltika. New
production files, modules, and directories must conform to this structure.
If a proposed component doesn't have an obvious location, update this file
deliberately rather than creating an ad-hoc directory — see
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

This file distinguishes the **target architecture** (where things will live
once built) from what is **actually instantiated for v0.1**. Empty
directories scaffolded for hypothetical future features are their own
maintenance burden — a directory is created only when a specific
[BUILD_PLAN.md](BUILD_PLAN.md) task requires it, not in advance.

## Instantiated today

├── review_packets/     — assembled review packet template/instances
└── reviews/           — review and discrepancy records
```

Nothing under `src/`, `data/`, `config/`, `docs/`, `tests/`, or `scripts/`
exists yet — v0.1 is still in Week 0 (source gathering and schema design,
BUILD_PLAN.md Tasks 1–9). Those directories are documented below as the
**target**, to be created incrementally as the tasks that need them are
reached, not all at once.

`engines/discovery/` and `engines/hypothesis/` are placeholders only:
Roadmap Doctrine puts Discovery and Hypothesis capabilities after v0.2, so
these subdirectories should not be created, or populated, for v0.1. Listing
them here is about naming the eventual slot, not authorizing early work.
Future Policy Search belongs on the orchestration side of `scenarios/`, not
inside `engines/simulator/`. No search directory is scaffolded now; its
module layout is a later design decision.

## The dependency boundary

Downstream code must not reach backwards around these layers:

```text
data/  →  semantics/  →  policy/  →  engines/  →  scenarios/
```

| Directory | May depend on | Must not depend on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/poltika/data/` | `common/` | `engines/`, `policy/`, `semantics/` internals |
| `src/poltika/semantics/` | `common/` | source-specific formats/APIs, `engines/` |
| `src/poltika/policy/` | `semantics/`, `common/` | `data/` (raw or processed), source-specific formats |
| `src/poltika/engines/simulator/` | `semantics/`, `policy/`, `scenarios/`, `common/` | Stats NZ (or any) API, source CSV structures, LLM output |
| `src/poltika/engines/assurance/` | `semantics/`, `policy/`, `scenarios/`, `engines/simulator/`, `common/` | source-specific formats/APIs |
| `src/poltika/llm/` | `scenarios/` (to build/read a `ScenarioRequest`) | `engines/simulator/` internals, raw/processed data |

The arrows above describe data flow, not permission for circular imports.
The simulator may consume a validated scenario request type, but must not
import scenario-runner, search, or candidate-generation logic. The scenario
runner invokes the simulator; a future search orchestrator invokes that same
runner and evaluates results against human-supplied constraints. Scenario
origin must not change the calculator's code path.

Concretely: the simulator must never do

```python
requests.get("https://api.stats.govt.nz/...")       # prohibited
pd.read_csv("data/raw/stats_nz/population.csv")     # also prohibited
```

It only knows something like `context.get("demographics.population.total")`
— it does not know whether that number came from a Stats NZ CSV, the Stats
NZ API, Treasury, Postgres, or a source not yet built. This is the same
`raw → processed → canonical variables → simulator` rule as the [Data
Acquisition Doctrine](BUILD_PLAN.md#data-acquisition-doctrine-frozen) and
[ARCHITECTURE.md's data-acquisition section](ARCHITECTURE.md#external-statistical-data-acquisition)
— never `raw → simulator` directly.
